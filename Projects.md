</p>

When you wish upon a star is a nationwide charity granting wishes to poorly children.

My role in this project was to develop the website from the ground up from designs provided by our designer. We chose an elegant CMS (Perch) that is easy for our client to update. From this CMS we generate event listings, granted wish stories and news articles.

I developed several API modules to pull custom JSON data objects from the CMS database, with the purpose of extending the CMS's functionality to support dynamically loaded article listings and plotting event locations on an embedded Google map.

In addition, I animated various elements throughout the site, such as the landing page slider animation, and the home page call to action icons.

The site is fully responsive and rigorously tested on a variety of devices.

Technologies used: PHP/MySQL, HTML5, SASS/CSS3, CMS, API, JS/jQuery, GSAP

Thorpe Molloy Recruitment is an award winning specialist recruitment agency based in Aberdeen.

Internet Strategies has held a long standing relationship with Thorpe Molloy, supplying design and development services and providing unique solutions that give Thorpe Molloy's online presence an edge over competitors.

My role with this project started with the refreshing of the site in 2014. I redeveloped the front end experience based on designs provided by our designer. We built a fully responsive site that scaled well to all devices and was rigerously tested. We introduced CSS3 animation elments for icons and enquiry form roll in's that were bold and simple.

I also participated in the back end development of the site, my tasks including:
- Development of AJAX enquiry forms and PHP form handlers tasked with database CRUD and statistical reporting
- Implementation of the Perch CMS, allowing our client to update team members and news articles. The news section was also overhauled to support dnyamic loading and filtering of articles
- Creation of PHP software that performed batch operations on large databases of jobs/applicants
- Creation of PHP modules that interfaced with older portions of the custom developed CMS

Technologies used: PHP/MySQL, HTML5, SASS, CMS, JS/jQuery

M2 Subsea is one of the largest independant providors of ROV and vessel services, project management, consulting and engineering.

My role in this project was to develop the site from prototype to delivery using HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP.

The goal of this project was to provide a website that is as eye-catching and innovative as the ethos of the M2 Subsea brand. We achieved this by building a beautiful responsive site with serene video backdrops and subtly animated elements.

Of note:
- The Perch CMS is used for the news section of the site, for which we developed a template system that handled article categorisation
- The complex unfolding logo animation on the home page is an SVG graphic that I animated using CSS3 and the Greensock API.

Technologies used: PHP/MySQL, HTML5, SASS, CMS, JS/jQuery, GSAP

My role in this project was to provide full back/front end development, logo animation and device testing.
