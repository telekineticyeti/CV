When you wish upon a star is a nationwide charity granting wishes to poorly children.

My role in this project was to develop the website from the ground up from designs provided by our designer. We chose an elegant CMS (Perch) that is easy for our client to update. From this CMS we generate listings of event contents, granted wish stories and news articles.

I developed several RESTful API modules to pull customised JSON data objects from the CMS, with the purpose of extending the CMS's functionality to support dynamically loading article listings, as well as plotting the events listing on a google embedded map.

In addition, I animated various elements throughout the site, such as the landing page's slider and the call to action icons which are also on the home page.

The site is fully responsive and rigorously tested on a variety of devices.

M2 Subsea is one of the largest independant providors of ROV and vessel services, project management, consulting and engineering.

My role in this project was to develop the site from prototype to delivery using HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP.

The goal of this project was to provide a website that is as eye-catching and innovative as the ethos of the M2 Subsea brand. We achieved this by building a beautiful responsive site with serene video backdrops and subtly animated elements.

Of note:
- The Perch CMS is used for the news section of the site, for which we developed a template system that handled article categorisation
- The complex unfolding logo animation on the home page is an SVG graphic that I animated using CSS3 and the Greensock API.
