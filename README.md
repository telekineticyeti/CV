## Interests & Hobbies

I have a keen interest in 3D printing technology. This interest has encouraged me to learn 3D modelling skills in both parametric design and digital sculpting software. I enjoy printing decorative and functional models that others have made, as well as sharing my own designs.

I enjoy spending time working on and with my homelab setup, with which I am frequently working on hobby coding projects and deployment of self-hosted services. Such projects can be found on my Github profile.

I also have a background in, and a fondness for illustration and art. I often engage in painting, printmaking and illustration workshops in my free time. Influences from these creative outlets often manifest in my work.
