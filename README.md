## Interests & Hobbies

I am enthusiastic about 3D printing technology and have developed skills in parametric design, digital sculpting and 3D modelling. I enjoy creating both decorative and functional prints, and actively share my projects with 3D printing communities.

In my free time, I maintain my home-lab setup, engaging in hobby coding projects and deployment of self-hosted services. You can find examples of these projects on my GitHub profile.

As a creative individual, I also engage my artistic side by regularly participating in sketching, painting, printmaking, and illustration workshops. These creative pursuits often influence and enrich my work.
